## VBA Challenge

This repository contains a VBA script that runs through yearly stock data and outputs information on each stock. For all of the stock tickers the script determines the yearly stock difference from the opening price at the start of the year to the closing price at the end of the year. The percentage of this change is also outputted along with the yearly total stock volume. Then from these calculated values the stock with the greatest percent increase and greatest percent decrease for that year is determined, as well as the greatest yearly stock volume. The repository also includes screenshots for the 2018 to 2020 stock findings after the VBA script was executed.
