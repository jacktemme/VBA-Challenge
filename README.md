Module 2 Homework

This repository has a VBA script that runs through the yearly stock data in the provided Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx file. For each stock ticker the script outputs the yearly stock change from the opening value at the beginning of the year to the closing value at the end of the year. The percentage of this change is also outputted along with the yearly total stock volume. Then from all of these calculations the stock with the greatest percent increase and greatest percent decrease for that year is outputted. The greatest yearly stock total volume is calculated as well.

This repository includes screenshots for the 2018 to 2020 findings after the VBA script was executed.
